# FDM-SCM-for-neutron-diffusion-alpha-eigenvalue
Test code for 2D transient neutron diffusion equation based on the finite difference method (FDM) and stiffness confinement method (SCM). 

Features
1. Stiffness confinement method (SCM) for neutron diffusion
2. Adaptive time stepping (ATS) for SCM based on the PKE predictor
